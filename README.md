# Orders robots from RobotSpareBin Industries Inc.

This is my implementation of Robocorp Course level II exercise using the Standard Robot Framework template.

In this implementation the robot will create the following folder structure:

- <project root> -
                 |-download
                 |-output-|
                 |        |- receipt
                 |-temp-folder-|
                 |             |- screenshot

Into that folders youll'find:
- download: the order CSV file
- output: the execution logs and the receipts zip file.
- output/receipt: the PDF documents containing the receipts
- temp-folder/screenshot: the robot screenshot
